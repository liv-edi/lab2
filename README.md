## Lab 2

[Home](https://liv-edi.github.io/cit281/)

In this lab we set up git user credentials, created a new git repo, created a JS file and added it to git, created a .gitignore file, used diff to see changes, used wildacrds, cloned cloud repos locally, and used branches and repo files.

Technologies used in this lab:
- VSCode
- git

The purpose of this lab was to pracrice using CLI commands for directory and file manipulation and for git commands.

From doing this lab I learned how to use my CLI to use git and also how to use git in a general sense. I struggled with these concepts at first and found myself redoing the lab over and over until I got it right.

```

function square(num) {
    return num*num;
}
console.log('Square opersations:');
for (let i=2; i<=10; i+=2) {
    console.log(`Square of ${i} is ${square(i)}`);
}
```
